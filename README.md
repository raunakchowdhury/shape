- Day 1: Implemented Merge, Insertion, and Selection Sorts.
- Day 2: Implemented Python's version of OOP and integrated sorting algorithms from Day 1 to sort a virtual library of books.
- Day 3: Same as day 2, but instead sorted Rational numbers in addition to mathematical functionality. Built a Tree object and implemented post-, in-, and pre-order traversals. Also implemented a rudimentary calculator that interprets a tree of numbers and math operations to print out the value of the tree.
- Day 4: Wrote a Stack object and used it to generate an expression tree (the "calculator" from day 3). Used a Stack to convert from infix to postfix notation.
- Day 5: Simulated the Josephus game with a circular Queue. Used the heapq package to HeapSort.
  - The [Josephus Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem):
    - Given N people in a circle, start with one person and count to K.
    - Eliminate the Kth person and repeat with the person after the Kth person.
  - Learned how to delete gravity:
    - ```
      import antigravity
      ```
- Day 6: Wrote [TopologicalSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) for directed acyclic graphs ([DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)). Implemented [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) using a Queue.
- Day 7: Used an AI to solve the 8-square variant of a [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle). More specifically, wrote Breadth-First Search and [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search). Wrote a second version of Depth-First Search that searches heuristically (eg. consider the states that that have the least number of moves to solve first).
