# shape
- Day 1: Implemented Merge, Insertion, and Selection Sorts.
- Day 2: Implemented Python's version of OOP and integrated sorting algorithms from Day 1 to sort a virtual library of books.
- Day 3: Same as day 2, but instead sorted Rational numbers in addition to mathematical functionality. Built a Tree object and implemented post-, in-, and pre-order traversals. Also implemented a rudimentary calculator that interprets a tree of numbers and math operations to print out the value of the tree.
- Day 4: Wrote a Stack object and used it to generate an expression tree (the "calculator" from day 3). Used a Stack to convert from infix to postfix notation.
